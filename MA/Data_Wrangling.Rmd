```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Review

We covered a fair amount last time, we'll re-run some code to get setup:

```{r, include=FALSE}
# Take note of our software environment
sessionInfo()

# Load Libraries & Packages
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

# Read Data, Assign to Data Object

getwd()


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
